- [ ] MaxMSP - develop and export binary <br>
- [ ] maybe(?) port to [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/ofxNetwork/ofxTCPClient/) eventually

TODO;
- [ ] Document openVPN config/setup

- [ ] Develop bidirectional transport control system
- [ ] Envelope follower for ctrl messages (midiout)
- [ ] MIDI over OSC
- [ ] Clock & CV out/+in
- [ ] GFX processing of audio matrices (GLSL) - export texture from Max for aday


CREATIVE TODO;
- [ ] network error as musical concept
- [ ] minimalism before maximalism - system requires space to breathe
- [ ] divide musical pattern structures
- * one does the downbeats while the other does the offbeat
- * one does the melody other does the harmony etc
- * [hocket](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfco2jnGtn4) ethos
